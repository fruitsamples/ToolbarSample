ToolbarSample
=============

DESCRIPTION:

This sample code shows how to use the Cocoa NSToolbar and NSToolbarItem classes.  This is used to add customizable toolbars to windows, similar to apps like Xcode and Mail in Mac OS X.  Using these classes (see NSToolbar.h, NSToolbarItem.h) involves adding a few menu items, implementing a few delegate methods, and writing the actions that get called when your toolbar items are selected.  Showing/hiding the toolbar in your window and running the customization palette are handled fairly transparently for you by Cocoa (more specifically, the AppKit framework). This sample also includes more advanced use of custom views in NSToolbarItems, where you can put a variety of controls, given a little more coding.
